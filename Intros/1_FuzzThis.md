# FuzzThis
To win this challenge, you need `FuzzThis::dontHackMePlease()` to return `win`. 

In very other challenge you want the test case to pass to win, but for this challenge you want the test case to fail. 

This challenge is meant to help you use basic fuzz testing in foundry. If you are unfamiliar with Fuzz testing in Foundry, check out their [docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/fuzz-testing). This should be the easiest challenge of the series so with that, good luck, and don't forget to read the writeup after!
